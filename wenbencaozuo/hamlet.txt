Hamlet
The last scene

HORATIO:
You will lose this wager, my lord.
HAMLET:
I do not think so: since he went into France, I have been in continual practice: I shall win at the odds. But you wouldst not think how ill all's here about my heart: but it is no matter.
HORATIO:
Nay, good my lord,--
HAMLET:
It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.
HORATIO:
If your mind dislikes any thing, obey it: I will forestall their repair hither, and say you are not fit.
HAMLET:
Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, it is not to come; if it be not to come, it will be now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he leaves, what is it to leave betimes?

(Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES, Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils.)
KING CLAUDIUS:
Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
(KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's)
HAMLET:
Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong. But pardon, as you are a gentleman. This presence knows and you must have heard how I am punished with sore distraction. What I have done might roughly awake your nature, honor. What I here proclaimed was madness. Hamlet denies it. Who does it, then? His madness: if it is so, Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong, his madness is poor Hamlet's enemy. Sir, in this audience, Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil. Free me so far in your most generous thoughts that I have shot mine arrow over the house and hurt my brother.
LAERTES:
I am satisfied in nature whose motive in this case should stir me most. To my revenge: but in my terms of honor, I stand aloof. Until by some elder honored masters, I have a voice and precedent of peace. By then, I do receive your offered love, like love, and I will not wrong it.
HAMLET:
I embrace it freely and wish this brother's wager frankly play. Give us the foils.
Come on!
LAERTES:
Come, one for me.
HAMLET:
I'll be your foil. Laertes: in my ignorance, your skill shall be like a star in the darkest night, stick fiery off indeed.
LAERTES:
You mock me, sir.
HAMLET:
No, by this hand.
KING CLAUDIUS:
Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet, you know the wager?
HAMLET:
Very well, my lord.
Your grace has laid the odds off the weaker side.
KING CLAUDIUS:
I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
But since he is better .we have therefore odds.
LAERTES:
This is too heavy, let me see another.
HAMLET:
This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
(They prepare to play)
OSRIC:
 Yes,my good lord.
KING CLAUDIUS:
(Set the cups of wine upon that table.)
If Hamlet gives the first or second hit, or quit in answer of the third exchange, let all the battlements their ordnance fire. The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath; and in the cup an union shall he throw. Richer than that which four successive kings. In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups; and let the kettle to the trumpet speak, the trumpet to the cannoneer without, The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth. Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin: And you, the judges, bear a wary eye. HAMLET:
Come on, sir.
LAERTES:
Come, my lord.
(They play)
HAMLET:
One.
LAERTES:
No.
HAMLET:
Judgment.
OSRIC:
A hit, a very obvious hit.
LAERTES:
Well; again.
KING CLAUDIUS:
Stay, give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is yours, Here’s to your health.
(Trumpets sound Give him the cup )

HAMLET:
I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.
(They play)
Another hit; what say you?
LAERTES:
A touch, a touch, I do confess.
KING CLAUDIUS:
Our son shall win.
QUEEN GERTRUDE:
He's fat, and scant of breath. Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub your brows; The queen carouses to your fortune, Hamlet.
HAMLET:
Good madam!
KING CLAUDIUS:
Gertrude, do not drink.
QUEEN GERTRUDE:
I will, my lord; I pray to you, pardon me.
KING CLAUDIUS:
(moving  aside)
 It is the poisoned cup: it is too late.
HAMLET:
I dare not drink yet, madam;
QUEEN GERTRUDE:
Come, let me wipe you face
LAERTES
My lord, I'll hit him now.
KING CLAUDIUS:
I do not think so
LAERTES:
(moving  aside)
And yet this almost against my conscience.
HAMLET:
Come, for the third. Laertes: you but dally;I pray you, pass with your best violence;
I am afraid you make a wanton of me.
LAERTES:
Say you so? come on.
(They play)
OSRIC:
Nothing, neither way.
LAERTES:
Have at you now!
(LAERTES wounds HAMLET; then in scuffling, they change rapiers, and HAMLET wounds LAERTES)
KING CLAUDIUS:
Part them; they are incensed.
HAMLET:
Nay, come, again.
(QUEEN GERTRUDE falls)
OSRIC:
Look to the queen there, ho!
HORATIO:
They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
OSRIC:
How is it? Laertes?
LAERTES:
Why, as a woodcock to mine own springs, Osric;I am justly killed with mine own treachery.
HAMLET:
How does the queen?
KING CLAUDIUS:
She passes out as she sees them bleeding.
QUEEN GERTRUDE:
No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--
The drink, the drink! I am poisoned.
(Dies)
HAMLET:
O! devil. Ho! let the door be locked: Treachery! Seek it out.
LAERTES:
It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet,You are killed. No medicine in the world can do you good. there is not half an hour of life for you .The treacherous instrument is in your hand, here I lie. Never to rise again: your mother's poisoned, I can know more: the king, the king's to blame.

HAMLET:
The point!—poisoned too!Then,poision to your work.
(Stabs KING CLAUDIUS )
All:
Treason! treason!
KING CLAUDIUS:
O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.
HAMLET:
Here, you , vicious, murderous, evil .Drink off this potion. Is
your union here? Follow my mother.
(KING CLAUDIUS dies)
LAERTES:
He is justly served; It is a poison tempered by himself.
Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
Mine and my father's death come not upon you, Nor yours on me.
(Dies)
HAMLET:
Heaven make you free of it! I follow you. I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, farewell! You that look pale and tremble at this chance, That are but mutes or audience to this act, Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death, Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you-- But let it be. Horatio, I am dead; you are alive, report me and my cause aright to the unsatisfied.
HORATIO:
Never believe it, I am more of an antique Roman than a Dane:
Here's yet some liquor left.
HAMLET:
As you’re a man, Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have it.
oh, good Horatio, what a wounded name. Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me! If you did ever hold me in your heart, absent you from felicity awhile, And in this harsh world draw your breath in pain. To tell my story.
( March afar off, and shot within,)
 what warlike noise is this?
OSRIC:
Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland, to the ambassadors of England gives this warlike volley.
HAMLET:
Oh, I die, Horatio; The potent poison quite over my spirit: I cannot live to hear the news from England; But I do prophesy the election lights . On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less, Which have solicited. The rest is silence.
(Dies)

The end
