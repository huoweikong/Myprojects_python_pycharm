## 反馈Bug和增加新功能

Bug reports are an important part of making pandas more stable. Having a complete bug report will allow others to reproduce the bug and provide insight into fixing. See [this stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve) article and [this blogpost](http://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports) for tips on writing a good bug report.

Trying the bug-producing code out on the master branch is often a worthwhile exercise to confirm the bug still exists. It is also worth searching existing bug reports and pull requests to see if the issue has already been reported and/or fixed.

Bug reports must:

1. Include a short, self-contained Python snippet reproducing the problem. You can format the code nicely by using [GitHub Flavored Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/):
    ```python
    >>> from pandas import DataFrame
    >>> df = DataFrame(...)
    ...
    ```
1. Include the full version string of pandas and its dependencies. You can use the built in function:
    ```python
    >>> import pandas as pd
    >>> pd.show_versions()
    ```
1. Explain why the current behavior is wrong/not desired and what you expect instead.

The issue will then show up to the pandas community and be open to comments/ideas from others.
